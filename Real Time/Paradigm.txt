PARADIGM TABLE

| Feature            | LOW MWL                                   | HIGH MWL                                    |
| -------------------| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Color cue duration | 7 seconds                                 | 5 seconds                                   |
| Number of colors   | 1 color                                   | 3 colors                                    |
| Time pressure      | Not immediate                             | 5-second countdown shown on screen          |
| Robot speed        | Slow, predictable             	         | Fast, pressure-inducing                     |
| Cognitive load     | Low: simple visual memory, no time stress | High: memory + time pressure + selection    |
| Interaction style  | Minimal, low engagement, more observation | Active, cognitively engaged with robot task |
| Visual complexity  | Low                                       | Moderate (more distractors & decisions)     |


REAL TIME TASK PARADIGM FLOW

[Start Block (Ground Truth: LOW or HIGH)]
        ↓
[Real-Time EEG Acquisition Loop]
        ↓
[4s epoch → Processing → Feature Extraction → MWL Classification]
        ↓
[During First 2/3 of Block]
        → Collect pre-adaptation predictions (Filling up the Majority Vote Buffer)
        ↓
[After 2/3 of Block]
        → Evaluate Majority Vote Buffer → Choose Robot Adaptation Command:
            - If MWL HIGH → Robot slows down & Amount of Battery selection simplifies
            - If MWL LOW  → Robot speeds up & Amount of Battery Selection increases
        ↓
[Last 1/3 of Block]
        → Robot behavior adapted (no further evaluation of MWL)
        ↓
[New Block Starts → Repeat Process]
