SETUP CHECK

CHANGE BACK ROBOT IP! 
CHANGE SUBJECT NUMBER!

SIGN CONSENT BEFORE EXPERIMENT START. (when preparing, before putting cap is good time)

Shut down multiplugs.

Impedance Checks between Calib and Exp.

SETUP:
	◦	Start Simulink Laptop and Simulink File
	◦	Montage and Connect EEG device
	◦	Impedance Check
	◦	Start Matlab TCP server for Simulink stream
	◦	Run Simulink to connect
	◦	Change robot IP .29. -> .0.
	◦	Run Python Script with TCP Listener
	◦	Connect Matlab to Python
	◦	Run Calibration. Stop Stream. Check Impedances. Reconnect Stream. Run experiment. Stop Stream. Check Impedances again.

FINISHED:
	◦	If robot has box when run is finished-> Run until no box (e.g., run command high) -> then run return home
	◦	Stop all streaming
	◦	Shut down EEG device
	◦	CHANGE ROBOT IP BACK -> .29.
	◦	Shut down Robot
	◦	Charge EEG device
	◦	Sort Subject Files into Folder -> make note to increase subject number for next experiment.


INSTRUCTIONS:
	◦	Left / Right handed? 
	◦	Explain Conditions (3vs1, time, robot behavior) 
	◦	Explain Task (empty, refill, from left to right, if robot is working there, skip it)
	◦	If 2 sec left -> memorize colors and finish task. (very important - never idle!)
    	◦   Put boxes within green borders (for robot to not get damage when picking up)
	◦	In experiment: When Adapt Screen -> stop what u do and start with new one
	◦	Ofc try to be fast, but more important: Try to reduce fast movements/ Not move too much with head (important for EEG)
	◦	Recommend to store batteries sorted -> easier to find
